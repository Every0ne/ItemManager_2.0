*This text is still at the drafting stage at this moment*

ItemManager (IM) is a simple flat-file framework for GetSimple-CMS that allows you to develop completely configurable PHP applications bundled with GetSimple-CMS.

ItemManager is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, to help to promote rapid application development, which saves you time, and reduces the amount of repetitive coding for developers.

Developers can utilize IM for various reasons, but the number one reason is for speeding up the plugin development process.

### Compatibility with previous versions ###
The ItemManager 2.0 was not only completely revised, but also totally restructured, as a result all previous versions of ItemManager are no longer compatible with ItemManager 2.0 version. 


### What applications can be realized with the ItemManager ###
The ItemManager is particularly well suited for the development of any software of sufficient size and complexity, but depending on the memory and server performance for small-sized data volumes. 


### Requirements ###
The included back-end example of the ItemManager 2.0 was made for modern, standards compliant browsers, older shitty browser are not supported. Please feel free to change this according to your wishes. The application has been developed on the basis of PHP 5.5.10 including some additional modules like GD. The IM has also been tested with * PHP version on an Apache Server under Linux. In theory the IM will run on lower versions of PHP like 5.4.0 as well but this was not tested.


### How this application works ###
Unlike previous version the IM 2.0 -API has been heavily optimized, and now enables even more dynamic development. The new API offers the full range of methods required to read and write access, controlling, filtering and searching of the item category and field data. The new modular concept also allows development of custom field types.

Traditionally, IM comes without any predefined front-end templates and leaves Developer free to code his own way. ItemManager 2.0 comes with a back-end area, however, the back-end is completely customizable, based on the available API and shall just act as an example. IM 2.0 allows you to cleanly separate the look of the site with the underlying function. That means Designers and Developers can work side-by-side, at the same time.
