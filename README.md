*This text is still at the drafting stage at this moment*

ItemManager (IM) is a simple flat-file framework for GetSimple-CMS that allows you to develop completely configurable PHP applications bundled with GetSimple-CMS.

ItemManager is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, to help to promote rapid application development, which saves you time, and reduces the amount of repetitive coding for developers.

Developers can utilize IM for various reasons, but the number one reason is for speeding up the plugin development process.

### Compatibility with previous versions ###
The ItemManager 2.0 was not only completely revised, but also totally restructured, as a result all previous versions of ItemManager are no longer compatible with ItemManager 2.0 version. 


### What applications can be realized with the ItemManager ###
The ItemManager is particularly well suited for the development of any software of sufficient size and complexity, but small-sized data volumes, depending on the memory and server performance. 






### Requirements ###
The IM was made for modern, standards compliant browsers, older browser are not supported.
10.10.3
The application has been developed on the basis of PHP 5.5.10 including some additional modules like GD. The IM has also been tested with * PHP version on an Apache Server under Linux. In theory the IM will run on lower versions of PHP as well but this was not tested.
